Welcome to **The Broken Crown**, a Victoria 3 total conversion mod that looks at a few key differences in history, taking a nod from Divergences.

# Key differences:
1. The American Revolution resulted in a much greater success, pushing Britain out of the New World entirely. This crushing defeat led to a total collapse of the British Empire, who underwent a liberal revolution and overthrew the monarchy, opting for a Parliamentary Democracy.
2. This new "Commonwealth" now spreads the revolutionary ideas of democracy to every corner of the world, fomenting unrest in states still ruled by an absolute monarch.
3. America's resounding victory left France in a much better position, allowing them to maintain their monarchy...for now.
4. With no power vacuum in France, Napoleon turned his sights to nearby Italy, where he reunited the country by force and launched his famous Napoleonic Wars, dominating Central and Eastern Europe with much more success than in our own timeline.
5. As a result, present-day Germany is broken up into multiple regional states: the militaristic Prussia to the east, the exiled British monarchy consolidating the northern states around Hanover, Bavaria to the south as they contend between French and Austrian influences, and the Royal Rhenish Confederation to the west.
6. The Turks are dead! Catherine the Great seized the opportunity in the chaos of Britain's collapse to crush the threat to Russia's soft underbelly, and with Austria's assistance, reinstated the Byzantine throne to round out the Three Emperors.
7. With one less European power, Spain and Portugal have something resembling a stranglehold on much of Latin America, with Spain's colonial holdings almost literally stretching from pole to pole along the Pacific Coast...but for how long?
8. In the fallout of their victory in the American Revolution, the fledgling United States took much of Canada, taking over half the country.
9. Russia also expanded their holdings in North America, further exploring the tundras west of Alaska.
10. The War of 1812 still happens. However, it's an emboldened America against a wavering France, which results in the seizure of the French-controlled Louisiana Territory. Just how much destiny can America manifest...?

A world of unrest, uncertainty, and possibly un-realism awaits. Will you etch your name in this new history?
